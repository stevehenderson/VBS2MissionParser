# VBS2MissionParser

A parser to convert a VBS2 mission into a nice readable XML file.

The idea was to be able to use VBS2 as a mission editor for flight paths.  Then export the flight paths into a readable format that could be parsed by another program called [ATC Visualization](https://github.com/stevehenderson/ATCVisualization)
